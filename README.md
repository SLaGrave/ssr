# SSR - Sam's Sh\*\*\*y Raytracer

My Rust personal project.

It is an implementation of [Peter Shirley's](https://github.com/petershirley) *[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)*.

1. This allows me to write more Rust code
2. This is how the book I'm following does things
